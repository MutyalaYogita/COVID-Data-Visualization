COVID Data Visualization

A basic data visualization application has been developed using Processing software and Java programming language.
I have taken a single day dataset of covid-19 positive cases on 22nd January 2020 and implemented the algorithm in it.
I have provided:-
1) Code
2) Data Set
3) The world map used for globe visual

The Figure below depicts the end result.
All the red lines show the areas which contain the confirmed cases on that specific day and longer its magnitude, higher the number of case in that area.
